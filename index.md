**PyContact** is a GUI-based tool for rapid, versatile and customizable
analysis of non-covalent interactions in molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories.

The *PyContact* tool is implemented in Python and is universally applicable
to any kind of MD trajectory supported by the [MDAnalysis](http://www.mdanalysis.org/)
package.

Its graphical interface enables both novices and experts to quickly analyze
MD trajectories for non-covalent interactions ("contacts"). Thereby, contacts
are evaluated in a distance- and geometry-based manner, independently of the biomolecule
type.

A [Tutorial]({{ site.url }}/tutorial) with installation instructions and basic usage
is available on this website. The development is hosted on [GitHub]({{ site.github.repo }}).
