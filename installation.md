# Quick Installation
To install the latest stable version with `pip`, run:
```
pip install --upgrade pycontact
```
or
```
pip install pycontact
```
Please make sure that `pip` installs PyContact for Python *version 2.7*, *not 3*
or higher.

If startup fails because of a missing _MDAnalysis_ package, run:
```
pip install mdanalysis==0.15
```

# More
If you have problems with the `pip` installation and/or want to build
PyContact yourself, please have a look at the [tutorial]({{ site.url }}/tutorial).
